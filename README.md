# Advent of Code 2019 (my PHP solutions)
This year I'm not focused on getting the answer as quickly as possible and am trying to balance speed with producing maintainable code. I endeavour to solve each of the puzzles this year using PHP to try and get used to some of the new language features that were just introduced in PHP 7.4 last month.

### Spotted a better solution?
Awesome! Please open a PR, I'd love to see it! The reason that I take part in AoC each year as a way to tackle challenges I don't normally face and so I may learn from them.
